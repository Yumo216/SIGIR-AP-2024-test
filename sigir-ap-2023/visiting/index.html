                <p>

                <h2><strong>Gourmet Paradise</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    Popular as a gourmet paradise, Beijing offers cuisines from all over the world as well as the following iconic local specialties:
                    <br>
                    1. Beijing Roast Duck: As a time-honored popular cuisine, Beijing Roast Duck can date back to the Southern and Northern Dynasties (from 420 to 589) when it was on imperial court menus. The delicacy is made of superior fat duck meat which goes through grilling over a charcoal fire. It boasts rosy skin and rich but not greasy meat. Together with being crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside, the nutritious roasted duck has been quite popular amongst all age groups, which makes it the most delicious food in China.

                <h2><strong>Transportation</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    Beijing is hailed as the paramount hub integrating air, rail, and road transport. In detail, it enjoys the largest airport and railway terminals in the country as well as many national highways and freeways radiating from here. The capital also boasts well-developed urban transportation systems. However, the metropolis has been held back by frequent urban traffic congestion due to its highly dense population. It is worth mentioning that the rush hours at 8 am and 6 pm should be avoided otherwise you are highly likely to come across serious delay. Therefore, we suggest that you do not take a bus or taxi at these hours for your precious vacation time.
                    <br>
                    In addition, the Beijing subway is suggested for its wide coverage and is well-reputed as the essential and most convenient urban public transport.
